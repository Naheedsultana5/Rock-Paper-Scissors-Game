# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to select between rock, paper, or scissors and play against a computer-generated move.

# Key Features:
-> User Interaction: Players can click on images representing rock, paper, or scissors to make their selection.
-> Game Logic Implementation: JavaScript dynamically handles game mechanics, compares user and computer choices, and determines the winner based on standard rules.
-> Score Tracking: The game maintains a scoreboard to display the user’s and computer’s scores in real time.
-> Dynamic Message Updates: Provides real-time feedback on the game’s outcome (win, lose, or draw).
-> Responsive Design: Styled using CSS to ensure a user-friendly interface on various screen sizes.
 
# Technologies Used:
-> Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-> Game Logic: JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Randomization)

This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications, apply JavaScript logic, and enhance user experience through front-end development.
